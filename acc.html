                <p>Dandeli resorts have become an attraction for wealthier, mobile residents from India and elsewhere. The biodiversity in the forest has attracted sufficient tourism to support a number of resorts in the vicinity of Dandeli. The government
                    has promoted eco-tourism with proper planning of the healthy breeding of wild animals. <br><br> The natural environment of the area attracts tourists from other parts of India and abroad.[9] It is an adventure sports destination, and
                    a white-water rafting destination in South India. It is one of the few locations where rafting is possible even in peak summer months of March to June. Dandeli also offers many other adventure activities like Kayaking, Zorbing, Jungle</p>

                    female literacy is 68%. In Dandeli, 11% of the population is under six years of age. Kannada is <br>
                    <br>the widely spoken language in the region. Dandeli's population was higher in the past, but lack of employment has forced people to migrate elsewhere. Jobs pay poorly, and traditional businesses have been disappearing for lack of
                    customers. The West Coast Paper Mills is one of the largest employers in the town and the primary landowner; the mill has its own quarters, shopping complex, theatre, restaurant, playground, and a clubhouse for the employees. The company
